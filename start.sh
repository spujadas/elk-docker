# spujadas 2015-10-09; added initial pidfile removal and graceful termination

# WARNING - This script assumes that the ELK services are not running, and is
#   only expected to be run once, when the container is started.
#   Do not attempt to run this script if the ELK services are running (or be
#   prepared to reap zombie processes).


## handle termination gracefully

_term() {
  echo "Terminating ELK"
  service elasticsearch stop
  service logstash stop
  service kibana stop
  exit 0
}

trap _term SIGTERM


## remove pidfiles in case previous graceful termination failed
# NOTE - This is the reason for the WARNING at the top - it's a bit hackish, 
#   but if it's good enough for Fedora (https://goo.gl/88eyXJ), it's good
#   enough for me :)
